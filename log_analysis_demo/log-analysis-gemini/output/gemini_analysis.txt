[ERROR #1]
Line: 104
Message: 2025-09-04 08:01:05 [ERROR] Failed to allocate IP address from pool 10.1.0.0/16
Explanation: The system failed to assign an IP address from the specified pool to a user equipment (UE).  This is crucial for network connectivity.
Context Analysis:  The error follows successful PDU session establishments for two UEs.  This suggests the IP address pool 10.1.0.0/16 might be exhausted or misconfigured.
Suggested Fix: Check the IP address pool 10.1.0.0/16 for available addresses. Verify the pool's configuration (subnet mask, gateway, DNS server). If the pool is depleted, increase its size or investigate why IPs are not being released properly (leaked connections, faulty DHCP server).


[ERROR #2]
Line: 176
Message: 2025-09-04 08:01:48 [ERROR] GTP tunnel establishment failed for UE: imsi-001010000000034, TEID allocation timeout
Explanation: The system couldn't create a GTP tunnel for UE imsi-001010000000034 because the TEID (GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier) allocation timed out. GTP tunnels are essential for transporting user data.
Context Analysis:  The error occurs after a successful PDU session establishment for another UE and a heartbeat message sent to a UPF node. This suggests a potential problem with the TEID allocation mechanism or network congestion.
Suggested Fix: Investigate the TEID allocation process. Check for any bottlenecks or resource exhaustion (e.g., TEID pool size).  Examine the GTP tunnel configuration, check for firewall rules blocking GTP traffic, and review network logs for other GTP-related errors.



[ERROR #3]
Line: 421
Message: 2025-09-04 08:04:18 [ERROR] AMF connection lost during session establishment for UE: imsi-001010000000081
Explanation: The connection between the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and another network element was lost while trying to establish a session for UE imsi-001010000000081. The AMF is critical for managing user sessions.
Context Analysis: The error is preceded by successful PDU session establishment for another UE and TEID allocation. This indicates a problem with AMF connectivity, possibly a network issue or AMF malfunction.
Suggested Fix: Check the AMF logs for more details about the connection loss. Verify AMF network connectivity (ping, traceroute). Inspect network infrastructure for any issues (link failures, routing problems). Restart the AMF if necessary.


[ERROR #4]
Line: 634
Message: 2025-09-04 08:06:28 [ERROR] Database connection timeout during session update for UE: imsi-001010000000047
Explanation: The system couldn't update the database entry for UE imsi-001010000000047 because the database connection timed out. This database likely holds user session information.
Context Analysis: The error occurs during a session update, suggesting a database performance or connectivity problem.
Suggested Fix: Check the database server's status (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Verify database connectivity from the 5G Core network element. Optimize database queries if needed.  Increase the database connection timeout if appropriate but investigate the root cause of the timeout first.


[ERROR #5]
Line: 828
Message: 2025-09-04 08:08:28 [ERROR] UPF node upf2 unresponsive, connection timeout after 30 seconds
Explanation: The User Plane Function (UPF) node upf2 is unresponsive, resulting in a connection timeout. UPFs are crucial for data forwarding in the 5G network.
Context Analysis: This occurs after a successful PDU session establishment and a heartbeat message sent to upf2, directly indicating a problem with upf2's availability or network connectivity.
Suggested Fix: Check the status of UPF node upf2 (CPU, memory, network interfaces).  Examine network connectivity between the 5G Core and upf2 (ping, traceroute). Restart upf2 if necessary.


[ERROR #6]
Line: 1051
Message: 2025-09-04 08:10:44 [ERROR] Policy enforcement failed for UE: imsi-001010000000079, PCF unreachable
Explanation: The Policy Control Function (PCF) is unreachable, preventing policy enforcement for UE imsi-001010000000079. The PCF is responsible for applying network policies.
Context Analysis: The error happens during a session modification request, implying a failure to communicate with the PCF.
Suggested Fix: Check the PCF's status and connectivity.  Verify network routing between the 5G Core and the PCF.  Inspect firewall rules. Restart the PCF if needed.


[ERROR #7]
Line: 1278
Message: 2025-09-04 10:05:13 [ERROR] Failed to allocate IP address from pool 10.1.0.0/16
Explanation:  Same as Error #1; the system failed to allocate an IP address from the 10.1.0.0/16 pool.
Context Analysis: This error, similar to Error #1, indicates a recurring problem with the IP address pool.  The time difference suggests it's not a temporary issue.
Suggested Fix: Same as Error #1, but with a higher priority.  Thoroughly investigate the IP address allocation and DHCP server.  Consider logging IP address allocation and release events to pinpoint the root cause.


[ERROR #8]
Line: 1294
Message: 2025-09-04 10:09:15 [ERROR] Failed to update QoS profile due to UPF timeout
Explanation:  The system failed to update the QoS profile for a UE because the UPF timed out.
Context Analysis:  The error occurs after a successful handover, suggesting a communication issue between the 5G Core and the UPF after the handover.
Suggested Fix: Check UPF logs for any errors around the time of the timeout. Verify network connectivity between the 5G Core and the affected UPF. Investigate potential overload on the UPF.



Summary of Recurring Issues:

The most significant recurring issue is the failure to allocate IP addresses from the 10.1.0.0/16 pool (Errors #1 and #7). This points to a serious configuration or resource exhaustion problem within the IP address management system that needs immediate attention.  There are also several instances of connectivity issues impacting different network elements (AMF, UPF, PCF), suggesting potential network infrastructure problems or misconfiguration that require further investigation.  Thorough examination of network logs, configuration files, and health monitoring tools is crucial to identify and rectify these problems.
